# Breaking Changes from v3 to v4

We are now fully migrated ðŸŽ‰ and all helpers are in typescript and working correctly

- `fumanchu` should be used as the primary way to do things now as `createHandlebars` is now deprecated!
- `FumanchuOptions` now enables you to do filtering
- Caching is now enabled by default! ðŸš€
